        <p class="p">By requiring you to verify your identity with a device, Duo adds another layer of
            security in front of the information, accounts, and assets you access online (even in
            the event your password is stolen). Once enrolled, you will be able to deny access to
            your accounts (on your Duo-enrolled device) if someone else is trying to sign in as
            you.</p>
